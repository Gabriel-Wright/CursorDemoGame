# Cursor Game Demo
This repository showcases a Java 20 game demo built with Maven, featuring graphics and GUI elements handled through Java's JFrame. The game loop engine takes inspiration from various online tutorials but is still developed from scratch.

## Features
- Cursor and entity collision! The cursor is your weapon, use it to protect the player from other entities! The cursor cannot pass through walls, so you must multitask to control both the player object (the square) and the player cursor (the circle) to survive.

- Avoid hitting red zones with your cursor, this causes you to lose charge needed to kill threatening entities
